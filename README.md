<h1><a href="https://www.dowhileblog.com"> ðŸ‘‹  Hi, Iâ€™m Ashwin ! </a> </h1>

I am a passionate web developer who believes in 'hack it till you crack it'. I am amazed by web development, blockchain, machine learning and IoT. I work primarily with ReactJS and have been using React Native for my personal projects. I believe in progress over perfection so I try to learn new concepts by toying around with small projects.


My priority for the next two years is to understand the nuances of web development and get exposure to technologies such as cloud and DevOps.
